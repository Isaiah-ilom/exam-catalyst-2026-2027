# 🚀 START HERE - Quick Setup Guide

## ⚠️ IMPORTANT: You Need Node.js First!

Your computer doesn't have Node.js installed. That's why you're seeing the "npm is not recognized" error.

## 📥 Step 1: Install Node.js (5 minutes)

### Download & Install:

1. **Go to**: https://nodejs.org/
2. **Click the GREEN button** that says "LTS" (Long Term Support)
3. **Download** the installer (about 30MB)
4. **Run the installer** (double-click the downloaded file)
5. **Click "Next"** through all steps
6. **IMPORTANT**: Make sure "Add to PATH" is checked ✓
7. **Click "Install"** and wait
8. **Click "Finish"**

### Verify It Worked:

1. **Close all terminals**
2. **Open a NEW PowerShell or Command Prompt**
3. **Type**: `node --version`
4. **You should see**: `v18.x.x` ✅

If you see a version number, **you're ready!** If not, restart your computer and try again.

## 📦 Step 2: Install Project Dependencies (5-10 minutes)

Open PowerShell or Command Prompt and run these commands:

```bash
# Go to your project folder
cd "C:\Users\Raphael Ilom\Desktop\CBT PRACTICE\exam-catalyst-2026-2027"

# Install backend dependencies
cd backend
npm install

# Install frontend dependencies
cd ..
cd frontend
npm install
```

**Wait for each to complete** - this downloads all required files.

---

## ▶️ Step 3: Run the Application

### Open TWO terminals:

**Terminal 1 - Backend:**
```bash
cd "C:\Users\Raphael Ilom\Desktop\CBT PRACTICE\exam-catalyst-2026-2027\backend"
npm start
```

**Wait until you see**: "Server running on port 5000" ✅

**Terminal 2 - Frontend:**
```bash
cd "C:\Users\Raphael Ilom\Desktop\CBT PRACTICE\exam-catalyst-2026-2027\frontend"
npm start
```

**Browser will open automatically** to http://localhost:3000 🎉

2. **Login**

4. **Select a subject** (15 available!)
5. **Choose question count**
